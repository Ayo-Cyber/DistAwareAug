# DistAwareAug
DistAwareAug introduces a new paradigm: statistically-governed augmentation. It learns the statistical distribution of minority classes (mean, variance, covariance, correlations) and generates synthetic samples that preserve these properties. A distance-aware mechanism ensures diversity while avoiding unrealistic outliers or duplicates.
